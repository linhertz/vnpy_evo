    * [portfolio_strategy](https://www.github.com/vnpy/vnpy_portfoliostrategy): portfolio strategy module, designed for trading multi-contract quantitative strategies (Alpha, option arbitrage, etc.) at the same time, providing historical data backtesting and live automatic trading functions

    * [algo_trading](https://www.github.com/vnpy/vnpy_algotrading): algorithm trading module, providing a variety of commonly used intelligent trading algorithms: TWAP, Sniper, Iceberg, BestLimit, etc.

    * [script_trader](https://www.github.com/vnpy/vnpy_scripttrader): script strategy module, designed for multi-standard portfolio trading strategies, also can be directly in the command line to achieve REPL instructions in the form of trading, does not support the backtest function

    * [paper_account](https://www.github.com/vnpy/vnpy_paperaccount): Simulation trading module, pure localization of simulation trading functions, based on the real-time quotes obtained from the trading interface for commission aggregation, providing commission transaction push and position records

    * [chart_wizard](https://www.github.com/vnpy/vnpy_chartwizard): K-line chart module, based on RQData data service (futures) or trading interface (digital currency) to obtain historical data, and combined with Tick push to display real-time market changes

    * [portfolio_manager](https://www.github.com/vnpy/vnpy_portfoliomanager): portfolio module, for all kinds of fundamental trading strategies, based on separate strategy sub-accounts, providing automatic tracking of trading positions and real-time profit and loss statistics

    * [rpc_service](https://www.github.com/vnpy/vnpy_rpcservice): RPC service module, allowing a VeighNa Trader process to be started as a server, serving as a unified routing channel for quotes and trades, allowing multiple clients to connect at the same time, realizing a multi-process distributed system

    * [data_manager](https://www.github.com/vnpy/vnpy_datamanager): Historical data management module, view the existing data in the database through the tree directory, select any time period data to view the field details, support CSV file data import and export

    * [data_recorder](https://www.github.com/vnpy/vnpy_datarecorder): Quotes recording module, based on the graphical interface for configuration, according to the demand for real-time recording Tick or K-line quotes to the database, for strategy backtesting or live initialization

    * [excel_rtd](https://www.github.com/vnpy/vnpy_excelrtd): Excel RTD (Real Time Data) real-time data service, based on pyxll module to achieve real-time push updates of various data (quotes, contracts, positions, etc.) in Excel

    * [risk_manager](https://www.github.com/vnpy/vnpy_riskmanager): risk management module, providing statistics and restrictions on rules including trade flow control, number of orders placed, active orders, total number of cancelled orders, etc., effectively realizing front-end risk control functions
    
    * [web_trader](https://www.github.com/vnpy/vnpy_webtrader): The web service module is designed according to the requirements of B-S architecture, and implements a web server that provides active function call (REST) and passive data push (WebSocket)


4. Standard network clients for connecting to exchange APIs:
    
    * REST Client ([rest](https://www.github.com/vnpy/vnpy_rest)): The high-performance rest API client based on coroutine process asynchronous IO which adopts the programming model of event message cycle to support the sending of high concurrent real-time transaction requests
    
    * Websocket Client ([websocket](https://www.github.com/vnpy/vnpy_websocket)): The high-performance websocket API client based on coroutine process asynchronous IO supports which sharing event loops with REST Client to avoid multi-threaded performance loss caused by GIL
